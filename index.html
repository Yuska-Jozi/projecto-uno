<h1> Welcome to <span class="purple-color">Yuska's</span> Musings </h1>
<h3> Alice-in-Wonderland's rabbit-hole is nothing compared to how deep this one drops... </h3>
<p> Like most folk, I too have wondered where God came from. But that's where my ordinary Musings and experiences srt of end </p>
<p>  I have pondered upon, and analysed, the relationship between longevity and population size. And modelled my findings mathematically. I have meditated on why there are seven primary races of humans, why the population has also seemed t max out at seven bil. I have seen visions of Alien abodes in m dreams at night. I had a dream that pointed to September 11 a few nights before it happened. </p>
<p>  I think I am not your normal guy</p>
